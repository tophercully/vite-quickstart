## Vite Quickstart

`npm install` then `npm run dev` and you've got a running web app.

This quickstart web template includes:

- TypeScript
- Prettier
- ESLint
- React
- React-Router
- Tailwind
- Vercel
- Vercel Analytics
- `Overused Grotesk` typeface
- `npm run dev` will start Vite and run Tailwind's watch command concurrently

Includes a color in Tailwind called `base` which is pure grayscale values from white at base-50 to black at base-950.
It also includes basic useful colors like `error`(red), `success`(green), `info`(blue), and `special`(purple)
